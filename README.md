# HackerRank Python Solutions


This repository contains solutions to 10 Python programming problems from HackerRank, covering fundamental concepts such as conditionals, loops, string manipulation, data structures, and more.


## Problems Included:

### 1. py-if-else

Uses conditional statements (if, elif, else) to perform decision making based on input values.

### 2. python-arithmetic-operators

Performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 3. compress-the-string

Compresses a string by counting consecutive repeated characters (run-length encoding).

### 4. the-minion-game

A string game where players score points by forming substrings starting with vowels or consonants.

### 5. write-a-function

Demonstrates how to define reusable blocks of code using the def keyword (functions).

### 6. word-order

Counts the occurrences of each word in input while preserving the order of their appearance.

### 7. iterables-and-iterators

Uses Pythonâ€™s itertools module to generate combinations and calculate probabilities.

### 8. python-tuples

Introduces tuples, immutable sequences in Python, and shows how to hash them.

### 9. finding-the-percentage

Calculates and formats the average marks of a student from a given dataset.

### 10. python-string-formatting

Demonstrates string formatting techniques to align numbers and text cleanly.


## How to Use

- Each problem solution is implemented in a separate Python script.

- Run the script and follow the input prompts to test the program.

- Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine.


### To run the command, use:
```bash
python <file_name>.py
